🛠️ 1. How does this actually work?

We make renovating easier by personally matching you with a small group of trusted local builders. You tell us about your project, and we handpick the right tradies based on your needs, budget, and timeline — no spam, no pressure.
💬 2. Is this just another lead gen site?

Nope. We're not a directory or marketplace where dozens of tradies fight for your job. We take the time to understand your project and only connect you with builders who are a great fit.
💸 3. Do I have to pay for this service?

No, our matching service is completely free for homeowners. You only pay your builder if you decide to go ahead with the project.
🧰 4. Are the builders vetted?

Yes. Every builder we work with is manually reviewed for quality, experience, and professionalism. We only recommend builders we’d trust with our own homes.
📍 5. Do you service my area?

We’re currently matching projects in [your city/region]. If you're outside of this area, you can still submit your project and we’ll do our best to help — or let you know when we expand.
🧑‍🎨 6. What kind of projects do you help with?

We help with a range of renovations, including:

    Kitchen and bathroom renos

    Full home remodels

    Extensions and additions

    Outdoor and landscaping work

If you're unsure, just ask!
🕒 7. How long does it take to get matched?

Once you submit your project, we’ll review it and get back to you within 1–3 business days with a shortlist of builders. From there, it’s up to you how fast you want to move.
✍️ 8. What happens after I’m matched?

You’ll get direct contact with the builders — no middlemen. You can chat, request quotes, and move forward at your own pace.
🧍‍♀️ 9. What if I don’t like any of the builders?

No worries. There’s no obligation. If none of the matches feel right, we’ll either suggest alternatives or leave it at that — no hard feelings.
🛡️ 10. Is my information safe?

Absolutely. We only share your details with the builders we match you with. We never sell your info or spam you.
